# 🦄 Makes Example

This is the official hands-on example for [Makes][makes].

## Why

As a framework designed
to simplify the development
of secure and high-quality applications,
[Makes][makes] comprises a wide range of functionalities
that may nonetheless overwhelm
those who are just starting
to learn how to use it.

That is why we created an example
that focuses on using the most basic
yet powerful builtins
[Makes][makes] has to offer.

This example simulates a
real application with
several deployments a day.

We will show how [Makes][makes] is:

### Secure

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-secure-brightgreen.svg" alt="secure">](#secure)

On Makes,
direct and indirect dependencies
for both applications and CI/CD pipelines
are cryptographically signed,
granting an immutable software supply chain.

### Easy

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-easy-orange.svg" alt="easy">](#easy)

Makes can be installed with just one command
and has dozens of generic CI/CD builtins.

### Fast

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-fast-blueviolet.svg" alt="fast">](#fast)

Makes supports a distributed
and completely granular cache.

### Portable

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-portable-violet.svg" alt="portable">](#portable)

Makes runs on Docker, VMs,
and any Linux-based OS.
Such a feature greatly simplifies
the task of running applications
and CI/CD jobs
on both local (developer machines)
and remote (dev, staging, prod) environments.

### Extensible

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-extensible-blue.svg" alt="extensible">](#extensible)

Makes can be extended
to work with any technology.

## How

We will achieve this by implementing

1. the [FastAPI example](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#example);
1. an isolated, cryptographically-signed environment
   for running our API;
1. development and production environments
   for our API using [Stackhero][stackhero]
   and [Docker Compose][docker_compose];
1. general-purpose linters and formatters
   to ensure code quality and security;
1. a distributed cache
   for high build performance, and
1. a CI/CD workflow using [GitHub Actions][github_actions]
   for orchestrating all the previous items.

# Prerequisites

## Concepts

Having a **basic** understanding of the following concepts
will probably make this example much easier to grasp:

- Continuous integration and delivery
- Containers
- Application dependencies
- Shell scripting
- Linters and formatters

Below, we give a **very brief** introduction to

1. [Nix][nix] and
1. [Nixpkgs][nixpkgs]

as they are foundational components of [Makes][makes].

## Software

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-easy-orange.svg" alt="easy">](#easy)

You just need to either have
[Makes](https://github.com/fluidattacks/makes#getting-started)
or
[Docker][docker]
installed on your system.

# Backbone: Nix and Nixpkgs

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-secure-brightgreen.svg" alt="secure">](#secure)
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-fast-blueviolet.svg" alt="fast">](#fast)
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-portable-violet.svg" alt="portable">](#portable)

[Makes][makes] relies on some core technology in order to work.

[Nix][nix] is a package manager
that treats packages in a purely functional manner.
That is,
packages are built by functions
that do not have secondary effects.
They never change once built.
Nix can be installed on any Linux-based OS.

Makes relies on Nix
to build reproducible and immutable workflows
and environments. It also takes advantage of its
granular cache obtained by having isolated packages.

[Nixpkgs][nixpkgs]
"is a collection of over 80,000 software packages
that can be installed with the Nix package manager."
The main advantage of [Nixpkgs][nixpkgs]
over other package repositories
is that packages are reproducible
and pinned to an exact commit version.
Compiled binaries for such packages
are also accessible through `cache.nixos.org`.

Makes uses Nixpkgs
for provisioning OS dependencies.

# Running any Makes job

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-easy-orange.svg" alt="easy">](#easy)
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-portable-violet.svg" alt="portable">](#portable)

Makes has the ability
to fetch any repository that supports it,
so you won't have to clone this example
unless you want to modify it.

Locally:

```bash
m github:fluidattacks/makes-example@main
```

Using [Docker][docker]:

```bash
docker run ghcr.io/fluidattacks/makes/amd64:latest m github:fluidattacks/makes-example@main
```

# Running Makes on containers

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-easy-orange.svg" alt="easy">](#easy)
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-portable-violet.svg" alt="portable">](#portable)
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-extensible-blue.svg" alt="extensible">](#extensible)

As mentioned before,
[Makes][makes] also has a [Docker][docker] container.
We can take advantage of this
on [CI/CD providers](https://github.com/fluidattacks/makes#configuring-cicd),
[Kubernetes][kubernetes],
[Nomad][nomad],
[Stackhero][stackhero],
and basically anything that runs containers.

In this example,
we have a development
and a production pipeline
using [GitHub Actions][github_actions].
Both of them can be found under `.github/workflows`.

Let's take a look at this job in `.github/workflows/dev.yml`:

```yaml
formatNix:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@f095bcc56b7c2baf48f3ac70d6d6782f4f553222
    - uses: docker://ghcr.io/fluidattacks/makes/amd64:latest
      name: /formatNix
      with:
        args: sh -c "chown -R root:root /github/workspace && m . /formatNix"
```

By looking at this portion of code
we can see that we use the [Makes][makes] container to run the
`m . /formatNix` command.

Thanks to this feature
you can make your entire ecosystem reproducible
on any remote environment
that supports containers.

# The makes.nix file

You will find this file in the root of the repository.
According to the [documentation](https://makes.fluidattacks.com/),
in this file you can specify any [builtin](https://makes.fluidattacks.com/api/builtins/)
supported by [Makes][makes]
and configure it to run on your project.

## Example builtin

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-easy-orange.svg" alt="easy">](#easy)

Let's review one of the builtins used:

```nix
{
  lintBash = {
    enable = true;
    targets = ["/"];
  };
}
```

The [lintBash](https://makes.fluidattacks.com/api/builtins/lint/#lintbash) builtin
lints all `bash` files
within the specified path `/`.

Let's try running it!

```bash
$ m github:fluidattacks/makes-example@main /lintBash

                               🦄 Makes
                             v22.11-linux

It temporarily clones the provided repository
and then executes `/lintBash` within it,
granting compliance with good practices
in all `bash` files.

## Working with a Nixpkgs version

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-secure-brightgreen.svg" alt="secure">](#secure)

We can also specify
what version of [Nixpkgs][nixpkgs] we want to use
by using [fetchNixpkgs](https://makes.fluidattacks.com/api/extensions/fetchers/#fetchnixpkgs).

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs = fetchNixpkgs {
      rev = "f88fc7a04249cf230377dd11e04bf125d45e9abe";
      sha256 = "1dkwcsgwyi76s1dqbrxll83a232h9ljwn4cps88w9fam68rf8qv3";
    };
  };
}
```

We can later reference
this version of Nixpkgs
to install any package we want.

## Using imports

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-easy-orange.svg" alt="easy">](#easy)
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-extensible-blue.svg" alt="extensible">](#extensible)

Another important builtin is:

```nix
{
  imports = [
    ./api/makes.nix
  ];
}
```

The `imports` builtin serves a very simple purpose,
which is being able to specify other `makes.nix` files
for [Makes][makes] to import them.

Any supported builtin
can be configured by either
adding it to the main `makes.nix` file
or to an imported one.

## Configuring the cache

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-secure-brightgreen.svg" alt="secure">](#secure)
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-easy-orange.svg" alt="easy">](#easy)
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-fast-blueviolet.svg" alt="fast">](#fast)

A decentralized [cache](https://makes.fluidattacks.com/api/builtins/performance/#cache)
for speeding up builds
that relies on [Cachix][cachix]
can be configured as follows:

```nix
{
  cache = {
    readNixos = true;
    extra = {
      makes = {
        enable = true;
        pubKey = "makes.cachix.org-1:zO7UjWLTRR8Vfzkgsu1PESjmb6ymy1e4OE9YfMmCQR4=";
        token = "CACHIX_AUTH_TOKEN";
        type = "cachix";
        url = "https://makes.cachix.org";
        write = true;
      };
    };
  };
}
```

This allows anyone running [Makes][makes]
to pull already-built [Nix derivations](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/expressions/derivations.html)
so they don't have to build the same thing twice.
All derivations are cryptographically signed,
which helps avoid cache tampering.

In case you did not know,
[Cachix][cachix] offers a [free tier for open-source projects](https://www.cachix.org/pricing)!

# The example API

In the `api` directory
you will find several relevant paths.
Such paths represent
the core components required
to make the API work.

## API Source Code

The path `api/src`
contains the source code
for the example API.

## API Environment

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-secure-brightgreen.svg" alt="secure">](#secure)
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-fast-blueviolet.svg" alt="fast">](#fast)
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-extensible-blue.svg" alt="extensible">](#extensible)

Under the path `api/env`,
you will find the implementation
of an isolated environment
for all the dependencies
required by the API to work.

- `pyproject.toml` will orchestrate the API
  and the dependencies required by it.
- `poetry.lock` is a lockfile
  with the entire dependency tree
  required by the API.
  Each dependency is cryptographically signed
  and points to the exact URL
  of the expected package.
  You can use [makePythonLock](https://makes.fluidattacks.com/api/builtins/utilities/#makepythonlock)
  to generate a lockfile for [makePythonEnvironment](https://makes.fluidattacks.com/api/extensions/python/#makepythonenvironment).
- `main.nix` is the core file
  for implementing [custom workflows](https://makes.fluidattacks.com/api/extensions/).
  For this specific example,
  it implements the [makePythonEnvironment](https://makes.fluidattacks.com/api/extensions/python/#makepythonenvironment)
  builtin that creates a Python Virtual environment using [poetry2nix](https://github.com/nix-community/poetry2nix/tree/74921da7e0cc8918adc2e9989bd3e9c127b25ff6).
  This environment will be used later on by the API.

  Try running `m github:fluidattacks/makes-example@main /api/env`.
  This will build the API environment.
  If you run the job again,
  it will use a cached environment
  from the previous build.
  Try changing the `name` input in `main.nix`
  and running the job again.
  As one of the inputs changed,
  the previous cache is no longer valid
  and a new version of the environment will be built.

## API makes.nix

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-easy-orange.svg" alt="easy">](#easy)
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-extensible-blue.svg" alt="extensible">](#extensible)

This `makes.nix` file contains several linters
that run on the API source code.

An interesting job is this one:

```nix
{
  lintPython = {
    modules = {
      api = {
        searchPaths.source = [outputs."/api/env"];
        src = "/api/src";
      };
    };
  };
}
```

Notice that it uses `searchPaths.source`
for loading the API environment
previously described.
The linter needs this environment to
run some checks like static type checking.

## API main.nix

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-secure-brightgreen.svg" alt="secure">](#secure)
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-portable-violet.svg" alt="portable">](#portable)
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-extensible-blue.svg" alt="extensible">](#extensible)

This is where a lot of the magic happens.

```nix
{
  inputs,
  makeScript,
  outputs,
  projectPath,
  ...
}:
makeScript {
  replace = {
    __argApiSrc__ = projectPath "/api/src";
  };
  name = "api";
  searchPaths.source = [outputs."/api/env"];
  entrypoint = ./entrypoint.sh;
}
```

This file uses [makeScript](https://makes.fluidattacks.com/api/extensions/fundamentals/#makescript)
to serve the API.
Here is a detailed description of every parameter

- `replace` allows the creation of placeholders
  that can later be replaced
  in the executed script.
  It uses [projectPath](https://makes.fluidattacks.com/api/extensions/fundamentals/#projectpath),
  a builtin that allows creating
  an immutable version of a path
  within a repository.
  By doing this,
  we will be able to reference
  the API source code
  in a semi-isolated environment.
- `name` just allows specifying
  the name of the job.
- `searchPaths` implements the [makeSearchPaths](https://makes.fluidattacks.com/api/extensions/fundamentals/#makesearchpaths)
  builtin.
  It allows us to provide
  all required dependencies
  to our isolated environment.
  For the API to run properly,
  we will source the [API environment](#api-environment).
- `entrypoint` is the shell script
  that will be executed in the job.
  It basically switches to the API source code directory
  and runs a webserver for the API.

Let's run it!

```bash
$ m github:fluidattacks/makes-example@main /api

                                    🦄 Makes
                                  v22.11-linux

```

That's it!

Now you can get
a running environment of the example API
with just one command, anywhere.
The entire environment exists within [Nix][nix],
granting full portability and ensuring that
no dependencies are directly installed on your system.
The entire dependency tree is fully pinned and
cryptographically signed.
If a component changes,
[Makes][makes] will rebuild
from there downwards,
reusing all caches that remain unchanged
and making sure all signatures are correct.

## API Deployments

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-easy-orange.svg" alt="easy">](#easy)
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-portable-violet.svg" alt="portable">](#portable)
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/attr-extensible-blue.svg" alt="extensible">](#extensible)

In the `api/deploy` path
we will find the job
for deploying the API.

The job takes one of these two parameters

- `dev` will deploy the API to
  `https://makes.fluidattacks.com/${GITHUB_HEAD_REF}`.
- `prod` will deploy the API to
  `https://makes.fluidattacks.com/`.

It requires these external variables to be exported

- `STACKHERO_SERVICE_ID` (required),
  for authenticating to [Stackhero][stackhero].
- `STACKHERO_PASSWORD` (required),
  for authenticating to Stackhero.
- `GITHUB_HEAD_REF` (required for `dev`),
  for setting the URL path.

Its relevant files are these:

- `compose.yaml` is the [Docker Compose][docker_compose] file
  used for deploying
  an instance of the API.
  Many of its parameters
  contain placeholders
  that will be replaced
  by the job
  during execution time.
- `entrypoint.sh` contains the script for the deploy job.
  It basically logs in to Stackhero,
  replaces all required placeholders in `compose.yaml`
  and deploys a new version of the API.
- `main.nix` provides another
  [makeScript](https://github.com/fluidattacks/makes#makescript) job
  like the ones reviewed above.

Let's give it a try!

```bash
$ export STACKHERO_SERVICE_ID=XXXXXXXXXXX
$ export STACKHERO_PASSWORD=XXXXXXXXXXX
$ m github:fluidattacks/makes-example@main /api/deploy prod

```

After a few minutes,
when we go to https://makes.fluidattacks.com/docs,
we get the following:

![Production environment](/static/deploy.png "Production environment")

Deployment jobs for both development and production
are supported using [GitHub Actions][github_actions].
Every time a developer opens a pull request,
a development environment for the API is created.
Similarly, once that pull request is merged,
a new version of the API is deployed to production.
